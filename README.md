# Zork GUI
This is a GUI clone of [Zork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork).\
Programmed in C++.\
This was developed as a project for my 1st year of [ISE](https://software-engineering.ie/) at UL.\
The aim of this project was to write clean, well structured C++ code and demonstrate an understanding of the core concepts of C++.\
JSON is used to store the map and other objects.
